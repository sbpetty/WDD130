    <p>
        My name is Benjamin Petty, and I'm majoring in Computer Science. 
        I enjoy coding, as well as playing the piano and singing with others.
        I'm a freshman, so I'm single and have NO children but I am the 8th of 10 siblings.
        I'm taking this course mainly just as credit for my major, but who knows?
        I might end up enjoying web development along the way.
        I've been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints
        for my entire life, and plan to go on a mission within the next couple years.
